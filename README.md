## How do I use this?

Right click on any image and there will be a new context menu: "Get Kalt text." 

Once you select this, a notification will pop up letting you know that the text generation has begun.

After some time, a second notification will appear with the text that Im2txt has produced.

You can click on this notification and the text will be copied to your clipboard.
